#0.0.5

- Specification, Statement, Exception from_dict functions now correctly return a new specification from the received JSON
- thrown error better descriptions
- a Parameter can be created from a Parameter (obvious but now also implemented...)
- a Specification can be created from any compatible obj (even from a Specification)
- Element now correctly initializes also from an obj ( _ bug) (with constrains)
- A Parameter is now a direct descendant of an Element. You can also directly create a Parameter
- Value of a Parameter can be undefined. isValid and met_by are not applied in this case
- _mpcv_hash debug. Now correctly reads parameters and constraints. Also metavalues are correctly considered (type and value)
- md5 replaced by sha1 in token generation
- If no name is provided for a parameter, Statemet defines a unique name for it
- Statement.getAllParameters
- Statement.getParameterNames
- Constraints getters
- Constraints.UNDEF now is null. This helps a lot in checking if is defined
- Constraints creator cleaned and debugged
- From a Specification now is possible to get a parameter value (getParameterValue)
- When we create an Element from a registry we memorize also the registry object id in _registryOID. It could be usefull also to register the registry we are using.
- ResultColumn now correctly inherits from Element in nodeJs way
- Statement resultcolumn rewritten and debugged.
- Elements can be directly created by json with the mandatory param type indicating the name of the oid from the registry we want to load.
- Constraints: unparse_constraints is now a global, not prototype, function
- Compliant with the standard messages of the reference implementation (Capability , Specification , Result ). 
    - Sending a message does not require any specifica action
    - Decoding of a received message (Statement) is done by means of mPlane.from_dict, that returns an instance of an object contained in the message.
      This same function can be of use for create any type of object from a JSON description
- Parameter constructor now works also with _value
- cloning of objects instead of simple copy in Specification
- Constraints params now correctly set by addConstraint when the config is a String
- from_dict can receive a string or an object. If the object is a Buffer (the result of a http request) it directly convert to JSON. This is a very common case.
- result and ResultValues correctly adapted in rows and column format of the RI (from_dict and to_dict)
- BUG scripting!
